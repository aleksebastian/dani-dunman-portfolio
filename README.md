# Daniela Dunman's Portfolio site

## Motivation

I built this portfolio for Daniela Dunman, a Texas State University Communication Design graduate. With her mockups and design guidelines we were able to successfully collaborate to build her website. My main motivation was to help her and also collaborate with a designer, while at the same time refining front-end skills.
