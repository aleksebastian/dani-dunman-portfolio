				<div class="pt-sm">
					<p class="med">My love for UX that makes changes.</p>
					<p>
						This was the first project that I worked on that was completely driven by research.
						Truth be told, when I first started working on this project, I came up with a different
						solution than I had imaged and found research to back it up. A few weeks into the
						project I realized that I was letting my project lead my research instead of letting my
						research lead my project. I also felt that what I was creating wasn’t going to make a
						difference in anyone's life. I scrapped everything I had until then and started once
						again from the ground up. In the last 3 weeks that I had to work on the project, I found
						and created what I’ve shown in this presentation. I hope you’re impressed! I was
						certainly very passionate about getting to work on a project that I saw the potential
						for making waves in financial education and the betterment of people’s lives.
					</p>
				</div>
			</div>

			<div class="full-text pb-md">
				<p class="label bold">Further Development:</p>

				<div class="py-sm">
					<p class="med">I would like to further develope the fidelity of this project.</p>
					<p>
						Because I had a limited amount of time to research this topic and create a realistic
						solution, especially after starting over halfway through that time, the furthest I was
						able to push this project was a low fidelity prototype.
					</p>
				</div>

				<div class="py-sm">
					<p class="med">I want to create the data bank (ba-dom-ch🥁) for the lessons.</p>
					<p>
						Being able to use the SmartBanking function is great, but where do we find all the
						lessons? Well, if I had additional time, that would be the next page I would design. I’d
						make a page where the user can take a quiz about what their needs are in regards to
						financial education and explore suggested workshops and additional/popular workshops.
