							Because this project was aimed at solving a problem in my own life and work, it was
							pretty easy to find the problem without having to do too much research. Because the
							company I work for is small and based in Brazil (2 employees total, including myself),
							there hasn't been a need for more sophisticated communication and file sharing. But
							this has made my job less efficient and file keeping and sharing complicated.

							I started looking into Content Management Systems (CMS) and Learning Management
							Systems (LMS) to see what programs were already out there that were.
						</p>
						<p>
							Educational LMSs like Canvas, Blackboard, and Tracs were helpful with organizing
							files, but there was no way of sharing them with other teachers.
						</p>
						<p>
							My first question was: Does anyone else have issues like this? So, to answer this, I
							looked around in my community for someone who had a similar job as I did.

				<p class="label bold">Takeaways / What I learned:</p>
				<div class="py-sm">
					<p class="med">
						Researching the solution carrier/vessel can sometimes be just as valuable as researching
						your problem.
					</p>
					<p>
						I had never used an iPad before doing this project, and I had a really hard time
						creating an app for it. I spent as much time researching and doing visual audits of how
						things look on an iPad as I spend researching for my solution. Besides learning how the
						iPad looks or works, I also learned its assets, features, and limitations which opened
						more doors (ba-dom-chü•Å) for features.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="py-sm">
					<p class="med">
						Assumptions hinder user experience and neglect the possibility of better outcomes.
					</p>
					<p>
						Even though I have so much first-hand experience in the job that I'm creating this app
						for, there is always more I can learn from other people. Talking to other people and
						getting other users' experiences is gold, even if the app is designed for my job.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="py-sm">
					<p class="med">The more I worked on this project, the more I found needed to be done.</p>
					<p>
						Appreciation for this app design is a HUGE thing I‚Äôve learned. I never really noticed
						how many edge cases there are and how many details seem minute but actually keep apps
						running smoothly.
					</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="full-text py-sm pb-md">
				<p class="label bold">Additional Development:</p>
				<div class="py-sm">
					<p class="med">
						I‚Äôd create a separate page for the contacts and progress history for each student.
					</p>
					<p>
						Having it all in one place makes for easy organization and keeps everything in one
						place. However, it might not be intuitive to have student records in the contact
						section.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="py-sm">
					<p class="med">
						I‚Äôd create more pages in the app such as a page and form for adding new students.
					</p>
					<p>
						It‚Äôs great to upgrade your small business with an app that helps you organize and
						communicate, but if this helps your business, there needs to be a way to do this in the
						app.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="pt-sm">
					<p class="med">
						I would create a social media aspect to the app that would help teachers share resources
						and tips.
					</p>
					<p>
						Teachers need a way to stay inspired, get new lessons, activities, and learn methods to
						teach students with different learning styles. If taken advantage of, having a community
						of people in the education field to chat with, and exchange ideas and activities could
						be a game changer for teachers/tutors and thier lessons.
