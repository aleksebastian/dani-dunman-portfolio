		I visited some museums and researched what some problem areas are in museum exhibits. From this,

		<p class="text-md">Museum exhibits lack context</p>
		<p>
			Museum exhibits that display objects aren’t engaging and they don’t put objects into context.
			Visitors don’t learn much from this other than what something looks like unless they read the
			plaque, which leads me to my next find...

	<div>
		<p class="text-md">Visitors don’t read plaques</p>
		<p>
			Museum visitors typically will look for the plaques for a displayed work they’re interested in
			but don’t take the time to read all of the information on the plaque. In fact, the more words
			on a plaque, the fewer words are read.

	</div>
	<div>
		<p class="text-md">Visitors don’t really know where to go</p>
		<p>
			Most museum visitors don’t follow any specific path; They wander around exhibits without
			having planned a route through the museum. Depending on the exhibit, this can hinder the
			effectiveness of the exhibit.

		Before I researched anything about radio, I focused on what kind of experience I wanted to
		create for the audience. There were a couple of things that I wanted to make sure were true for
		my exhibit, so I made a list that I came back to to make sure I was still focused on the
		challenge at hand. I call it the “needs to be true” list.
